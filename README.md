# To-Do List Application

This project is a simple and efficient To-Do List application built using Android with Room Database, ViewModel, LiveData, and RecyclerView. The application allows users to manage tasks with features like adding, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as attaching files to tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and categories.
- **Update Tasks**: Users can update existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks.
- **Attach Files**: Users can attach files to tasks.
- **Notifications**: Users can enable notifications for tasks.
- **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks by status (All, Pending, Completed, Urgent).

## Application Overview

The To-Do List application is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Upon launching the app, users are presented with a list of tasks. They can easily add new tasks by providing a title, description, due date, and category. The app also allows users to update or delete existing tasks. 

Users can attach file to tasks. This makes it easier for users to keep relevant documents, images, or other files associated with their tasks in one place. The attachments can be viewed onClick, and the presence of attachments is visually indicated.

The app provides a notification feature, allowing users to enable reminders for specific tasks. This ensures that important tasks are not forgotten. Additionally, tasks can be filtered by their status, making it simple to focus on pending, completed, or urgent tasks.

The user interface is intuitive, with clear visual cues and straightforward navigation. The main screen displays all tasks, and users can tap on a task to view its details or long-press to delete it. Tasks with attachments are easily identifiable, and the app handles permissions and file access smoothly.

### User Interface

- **Main Screen**: Displays a list of all tasks with options to add, update, delete, and filter tasks.
- **Task Details Screen**: Allows users to view and edit task details, as well as manage attachments.
